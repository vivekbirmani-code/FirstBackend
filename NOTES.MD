- a server is just a software, which serves, server can be a laptop, mobile anything etc, servers of comapnies are generally big computers with best specifications 
- Backend Development has 2 components - A programming Language and Database
- 1st Component of Backend developemnt is A programming language, foreg.- JavScript, Java, PHP, golang, C++, in all of this a we will use framework or library 

- 2nd Component of Backend development is A Database for eg.- Mongo, MySQL, Postgre, sqlite
- we have recieved the data, from where we will se that afterwards, That recieved data must go through some processing, verify it analyze it, and then enter it to the database. 
- if a query is recieved, we fetch the data from the database and that data will be shown in frontend
- we have to study atleast one database
- as we have to use any framework of any language in any programming language, similarly we have to use a ORM or ODM in database, most of our intercation in backend devopment will be in ORM or ODM, 


- A Database is always in another continent


- whenever we will make a database or backend we will deal with 3 things - Data, File, Third Party(APIs)
- data can be anything, username, password, string, object, number etc..
- data can also be a file like, image, pdf, videos, etc..
- or we can talk to third party API, like we have to login google, or we have to upload a file in AWS, they also give a API, we interact through them using APIs
- so all in all we either handle data directly or through files or through third part APIs

## File Structure - 
- we will store all the code files in the src directory
- Package.json
- .env

- in src we have index file, APP, constants
- usually we connect database in index file
- and all the configurations, cookie etc is in APP file
- the constants file is very important to maintain
